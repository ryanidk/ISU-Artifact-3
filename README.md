# ISU Artifact 2 - Data

### [Access the website here](https://isu-artifact-2.ryanidk.com/)

This code is for my second ISU artifact, focusing on data, scatter plots, and other graphs. This website features a calculator for various statistics (including an AI explainer), a grapher featuring pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, and bar graphs, a stock grapher, and a weather grapher.

As a bonus, I have created a tower defense game that can be found in `tower-defense.py`. It's pretty simple and only uses circles, but it's a fun little game to play around with.

This project is built with Python and Flask for the backend, with a HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It is run using Docker and Gunicorn on a cloud VPS. The AI functions are powered by Llama 3.1 8B, running on Groq cloud. The stock functions are powered by Yahoo Finance, and the weather functions are powered by ï£¿ Weather and Mapbox.# ISU-Artifact-3
