# ISU Artifact 3 - Data

### [Access the website here](https://isu-artifact-3.ryanidk.com/)

This code is for my third ISU artifact, focusing on budgeting, compound interest, appreciation and depreciation, stocks, and more. The budgeting function saves in localstorage and charts are made by Highcharts and Canvas.JS.

This project is built with Python and Flask for the backend, with a HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It is run using Docker and Gunicorn on a cloud VPS. The stock functions are powered by Yahoo Finance.
